git clone <repository-url>
cd BlackJack
```

2. Install dependencies (if any):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If requirements.txt exists
```

3. Run the game:
```bash
# Console version
python main.py

# GUI version
python mainActivity.py
```

## How to Play

### Starting a Game
1. **Console**: Run `python main.py` and follow prompts
2. **GUI**: Run `python mainActivity.py`, set parameters, and click "Start New Game"

### Game Controls

#### Console Interface
- Enter cards as prompted (A, 2-10, J, Q, K)
- Choose actions by typing: h (hit), s (stand), d (double), p (split)
- Use special commands: UNDO, RESTART

#### GUI Interface
- **Card Input**: Type cards in the input field or use dropdown
- **Player Actions**: Click buttons or use keyboard shortcuts
  - `H` - Hit
  - `S` - Stand  
  - `D` - Double
  - `P` - Split
  - `B` - Bust (for other players)
- **Utility Commands**:
  - `Ctrl+Z` - Undo last action
  - `Ctrl+R` - Restart round
  - `F1` - Show help

### Card Counting System

The game implements the **Omega II** counting system:
- **Low cards** (2,3,7): +1
- **Medium cards** (4,5,6): +2  
- **Neutral cards** (8,A): 0
- **High cards** (9): -1
- **Face cards** (10,J,Q,K): -2

The system provides:
- **Running Count**: Raw count of cards seen
- **True Count**: Running count divided by remaining decks
- **Betting Strategy**: Recommended bet sizes based on true count
- **Wonging Strategy**: When to enter/leave the table

## Game Rules

### Standard BlackJack Rules
- Goal: Get as close to 21 as possible without going over
- Face cards worth 10, Aces worth 1 or 11
- Dealer hits on soft 17
- BlackJack pays 3:2
- Insurance available when dealer shows Ace

### Special Actions
- **Hit**: Take another card
- **Stand**: Keep current hand
- **Double**: Double bet and take exactly one more card
- **Split**: Split pairs into two separate hands
- **Insurance**: Side bet when dealer shows Ace
